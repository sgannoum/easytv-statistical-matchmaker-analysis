# EasyTV Statistical Matchmaker: Analysis Component

## Introduction

The analysis module is one of several components of the EasyTV Statistical Matchmaker. 
The other components are the [runtime component](https://github.com/REMEXLabs/GPII-Statistical-Matchmaker) and 
the [training data](https://github.com/REMEXLabs/GPII-Statistical-Matchmaker-Data). 

How do these three components fit together? 
First, the analysis component analyses all the available user profiles (cf. the training data) and outputs
data structures that the runtime component can use in order to respond to matchmaking requests. 
Since the clustering algorithms used by the analysis component are computationally intensive, 
these algorithms would only run at certain regular intervals, e.g. once a day. 
Second, the runtime component uses the data generated by the analysis component to respond to matchmaking requests. 

The current training data will be phased out when the number of real EasyTV becomes big enough to
use their preference sets for clustering. 


## Getting the Analysis Component

Simply run the following command in a directory of your choice: 
```
git clone https://varlab.iti.gr:9443/easytv-hyper-personalisation/easytv_stmm_analysis.git
```

## Compiling the Analysis Component

### Compiling 

Just run

mvn install

## Running the Analysis Component

You need a collection of users preference sets in .ini format. See [training data repository](https://github.com/REMEXLabs/GPII-Statistical-Matchmaker-Data) for details. This description assumes that you used the official [training data repository](https://github.com/REMEXLabs/GPII-Statistical-Matchmaker-Data).
There are three important command line parameters you have to set for the analysis tool.
* `-p` should point to the folder storing the preferences. It will recursively take all .ini files as preferences.
* `-c` should point to the `config.ini` file.
* `-o` should point to the file (including its path) that represents the output of the analysis. 

For example:

	java -jar StatisticalAnalysis.jar -p "C:\EasyTV-Statistical-Matchmaker-Data" -c "C:\EasyTV-Statistical-Matchmaker-Data\config.ini" -o "C:\EasyTV-Statistical-Matchmaker\lib\StatisticalMatchMakerData.js"
